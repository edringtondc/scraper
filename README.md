# scraper

Not sure whether these created the problems but to debug: 

1. under article.handlebars lineno:5, change target = "_blank" . 
2. Add some static heading at line 3(before loop #each) to check whether this gets called. 
3. Yes you were right we need to change the line no 7 to "/articles". (edited) 
4. console.log at line 8(scrapper/routes/view/index.js) to display articles. (edited)
